we gave you the following knowledge base:
```
directTrain(saarbruecken,dudweiler).
directTrain(forbach,saarbruecken).
directTrain(freyming,forbach).
directTrain(stAvold,freyming).
directTrain(fahlquemont,stAvold).
directTrain(metz,fahlquemont).
directTrain(nancy,metz).
```
We asked you to write a recursive predicate `travelFromTo/2` that told us when
we could travel by train between two towns.

Now, itâ€™s plausible to assume that whenever it is possible to take a direct
train from `A` to `B`, it is also possible to take a direct train from `B` to
`A`. Add this information to the database. Then write a predicate `route/3`
which gives you a list of towns that are visited by taking the train from one
town to another. For instance:
```
?-  route(forbach,metz,Route).
Route  =  [forbach,freyming,stAvold,fahlquemont,metz]
```
